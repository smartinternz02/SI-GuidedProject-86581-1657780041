The agricultural land mass is more than just being a feeding source in todayâ€™s world. Indian economy is highly dependent of agricultural productivity. This is the one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field. If proper care is not taken in this area then it causes serious effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. Detection of plant disease through some automatic technique is beneficial as it reduces a large work of monitoring in big farms of crops, and at very early stage itself it detects the symptoms of diseases i.e. when they appear on plant leaves. 

The suggested technique proves to be beneficial in monitoring large fields of crops. Automatic detection of the diseases by just seeing the symptoms on the plant leaves makes it easier as well as cheaper. Deep learning techniques are used to identify the diseases and suggest the precautions that can be taken for those diseases.

# Project Flow
A web Application si built  where 

-> Farmers interact with the portal build.

-> Interacts with the user interface to upload images of diseased leaf.

-> Our model built analyses the Disease and suggests the required fertilizers.

To accomplish the above task you must complete the below activities and tasks 

-> Download the dataset.

-> Classify the dataset into train and test sets.

-> Add the neural network layers.

-> Load the trained images and fit the model.

-> Test the model.

-> Save the model and its dependencies.

-> Build a Web application using a flask that integrates with the model built.

# Future Scope
Further research may implements this proposed project with the existing public datasets. Also, various algorithms can be implemented to improve accuracy. The proposed project can be modified further to identify the disease that affects the various plant organs such as stems and fruits.
